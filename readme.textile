h1. Jubula GUI tests for Elexis 3.1

Here Niklaus tries to make a new, better environment for running the Jubula GUI-tests.

The following improvements are planned. Order may be varied depending whether we will encounter unforeseen problems.

* Move to current Jubula-Version 8.2
* Simplify vastly the ruby scripts. Ideas are:
** Move all config-variables in one (or more) YAML-files
** Add simple script to download Elexis-Opensource from Jenkin-CI
** Add simple script to use Medelexis-Zip/license.xml from a given local directory
** Add the jubula*jar for running the tests to this project for easy installation
* Run Jubula-Tests inside a docker environment (to work around libwebkit-gtk problem under Linux)
* Rework visiting all Views and Perspectives to use the Jubula-provided tools
* Migrate to use Java-based UI test automation. This should ease the pain from other developpers to get a head start.
* Add a custom articlestamm.xml with a good selection of drugs to make a good demo
* Find a way to properly identify each tab of a combo, e.g. the various articlestamm
* Rework some Elexis-GUI elements, e.g.
** DatePickers should allow entering a date via the keyboard. This is needed when a consultation for a previous date has to be entered
* Complete basic tests til we can prove that Elexis creates correct bills
